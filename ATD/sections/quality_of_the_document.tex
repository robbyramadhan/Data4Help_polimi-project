\subsection{Code}

The code is well strctured, with java classes properly organized in packages. Variable names are significative, and every function is properly commented.

\subsection{Application}

The application is much different from what was presented as mock ups in the RASD document, being a little confusing at first glance; however being this a prototype, it properly presents the functions of the system. It has some minor malfunction, as stated in the previous chapter, but overall it serves its purpose while not caring much on presentation.

\subsection{Documentation}

The three documents, RASD, DD and ITD, are coherent and the source code is properly documented (and also commented).
