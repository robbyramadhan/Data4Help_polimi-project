All components were tested as they were being developed. The tools used for testing vary based on the component's platform.

\subsection{Backend server}

The components of the Backend server were tested with Node js through the use of Mocha and Chai modules, and with Postman software tool. Every REST endpoint and funcionality was tested after its development, among the previously developed ones.

Depending on the functionality, a test case could include one or more endpoints/funcions, or even more than one component, thus ensuring the correct operation of all the agents involved.

Mocha tests are defined in the test/test.js file, while a simple Postman collection is provided in test/postman.json. See chapter 6 for instructions on how to use them.
