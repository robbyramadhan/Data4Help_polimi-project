# Data4Help Polimi project
Repo for the Software Engineering 2 project, Politecnico di Milano, 2018/19

RASD (Requirement Analisys and Specification Document) and DD (Design Document) are docs.
ITD (Implementation and Testing... Document) is the (partial) implementation and its documentation.

Extract from RASD:
```
In the last few years wearable devices are increasingly used. The evolution of wearables in
the medical field has made possible to measure vital parameters useful for understanding the
state of health of a person. The application for TrackMe uses this feature.
The main service is Data4Help which is a software system capable of sending and receiving
informations about our customers, collected through the use of wearable devices, as accurately as
the currently widely available technology permits. Such information includes current location, in
terms of geographical position, and body parameters, such as heartbeat rate and blood pressure.
This data has great value so the goal is to make it available for other companies to use for their
purposes; they will only need to file a request to the system that, when approved, will guarantee
access to information, currently collected and yet to be, regarding a specific customer or to a
group of people satisfying certain criteria.
Moreover, the software will offer two other services that will make use of this data base.
The first one is AutomatedSOS, which will target mainly elderly people. The software will
constantly monitor their health status, and in case of emergency will promptly dispatch an
ambulance to their current location, notifying the customer of its arrival.
The second one is Track4Run, which will allow the organizers of a running event to define
the path for it, the athletes to enroll in the event, and the spectators to track the position of the
runners on a map in real time.
